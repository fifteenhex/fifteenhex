### Ho ho ho

I wondered how people made a page about how great they are appear on their profile and now I know!

#### Achievements

- First double free added to the kernel: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0b9266d295cee170509539635b8d572abe5267af

#### Work flow:

- Github actions are updating my copies of repos like Linux, u-boot etc once a day.
- A local drone.io instance builds anything that needs to be built. Building buildroot images is not a task for public CI providers due to how long they take.
